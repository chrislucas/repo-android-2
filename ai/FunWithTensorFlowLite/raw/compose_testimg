InstantTaskExecutorRule rule

The InstantTaskExecutorRule is a JUnit test rule for Android Architecture Components
(like LiveData, ViewModel, Room) that makes background tasks run synchronously
(immediately) instead of asynchronously, solving the "no main thread in tests" problem,

InstantTaskExecutorRule for stateflow
The InstantTaskExecutorRule is not needed for testing StateFlow.
This rule is specific to Android's LiveData and architecture components,
as it synchronizes background tasks on a single thread during tests.
