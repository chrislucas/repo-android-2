Key Skills and Topics Covered
Most reputable Android bug bounty courses focus on:

Lab Setup: Configuring a safe testing environment using emulators (e.g., Android Virtual Devices, Genymotion) or rooted/jailbroken physical devices with tools like Magisk.

Tools: Proficiency with industry-standard tools such as Burp Suite (for traffic interception), Frida and Objection (for dynamic instrumentation/hooking), JADX and APKTool (for reverse engineering and decompilation), and ADB (Android Debug Bridge).

Static and Dynamic Analysis: Analyzing application source code and manifest files (static analysis) and monitoring the app's behavior at runtime (dynamic analysis).

Bypassing Security Measures: Techniques to bypass SSL pinning, root detection, and emulator checks are crucial for effective testing.

Common Vulnerabilities: Understanding and exploiting flaws related to the OWASP Mobile Top 10, such as insecure data storage, insecure communication, side-channel data leakage, and improper authentication.

Reporting: Learning to write high-quality reports with necessary information to reproduce and assess the vulnerability, a critical step for earning bounties.
